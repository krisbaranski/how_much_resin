# how_much_resin?

Beside pasionate learning of programming, one of my hobbies is to work with wood and make it look precious and noble. This i can reach with treating wood with epoxy resin, fluid which becomes very hard after casting/pouring into the pieces of wood. Depending on idea stays transparent or becomes coloured. One can see many examples on internet, just search i.e for "river table".

This simple, one page calculator makes it easy to count, how much epoxy resin one will need for pouring and making your wood a masterpiece :-)

For this you need to measure (in 'cm' and with '.' for decimals) approximate length, width and height of the gap you want to cast. Then fill in the input fields and push button 'calculate' :-)

The result is the exact amount of epoxy resin you need to use for casting.

I have used this method many times and it is always working great.

Enjoy!
