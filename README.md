# how_much_resin?

The idea came to me, because beside pasionate learning of programming, one of my many hobbies is to work with wood and make it look precious and noble.
This i can reach with treating wood with epoxy resin, fluid which becomes very hard after casting/pouring into the pieces of wood. Depending on idea stays transparent or  becomes coloured. One can see many examples on internet, just search i.e for "river table".

This simple, one page calculator makes it easy to count, how much epoxy resin one will need for pouring and making your wooden piece a masterpiece :-).

Enjoy!
